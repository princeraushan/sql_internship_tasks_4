# SQL Developer Internship – Task 4  
## Sorting and Limiting Data Using ORDER BY, LIMIT & OFFSET

## 📌 Task Overview
Task 4 focuses on organizing and controlling query results using SQL sorting and limiting techniques.  
The goal is to understand how to arrange data in a meaningful order and retrieve only the required number of records.

This task uses the existing `students` table created and enhanced in previous tasks.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL Community Server  
- MySQL Workbench  

(All tools used are free, as per internship guidelines)

---

## 🎯 Task Objectives
The following SQL concepts were practiced and implemented:

- Sorting records using `ORDER BY`
- Using ascending (`ASC`) and descending (`DESC`) order
- Sorting using multiple columns
- Limiting result sets using `LIMIT`
- Implementing pagination using `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`
- Combining `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`
- Writing real-world queries such as leaderboards

---

## 🔍 Concepts Demonstrated

### ORDER BY
Used to sort query results based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.

### Multiple Column Sorting
Allows secondary sorting when primary column values are the same.

### LIMIT
Restricts the number of rows returned by a query.

### OFFSET
Skips a specified number of rows and is commonly used for pagination.

### Combined Queries
Demonstrates how filtering, sorting, and limiting work together in real-world applications.

## 📄 Files Included
- `task4.sql` – Contains all SQL queries demonstrating:
  - ORDER BY with ASC and DESC
  - Multi-column sorting
  - LIMIT usage
